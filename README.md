# maubot-llm
A Matrix AI chat bot using [Oogabooga's text-gen-webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui) backend.
Based on the [ChatGPT Maubot Plugin](https://github.com/williamkray/maubot-chatgpt)

This bot is still in early stages of development, and will probably require tinkering to run it.

## TODO:

- Add proper support for multi character chats (stopping strings currently only include the author of the last message)
- Add support for TavernAI character cards
